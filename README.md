# Project 2 - *BeReal Clone PT 1*

Submitted by: **Noah Russell** ZNumber: **Z23667779**

**BeReal Clone PT 1** is the first part of a two-part project which clones some of the main functionalities of the trending app called BeReal. In this app, users post a photo of what they’re currently doing upon receiving a random notification during the day. Only after posting a photo can the user see their friends’ photos. The app features a user-friendly interface, allowing for easy registration and login processes, as well as a seamless feed that displays posts from friends. With the ability to upload images from their photo library and add optional captions, users can personalize their contributions and express themselves creatively.

## Notes

Project was very simple and easy to create. Following the professors lectures + the codepath lab, resulted in this not being too time consuming. The back4app was having a few issues but a TA helped me fix any issues I had. I'm very exciting for part 2 of this project.
